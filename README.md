#Migrating to Hugo site engine and Digitalocean servers

It's a great site, but horrible hosting. The plan is to:

1. Migrate from Rackspace to Digitalocean
2. Adapt the site for Hugo -- including `partials`, `params` etc. This way, posts may actually be possible :)
	* This means a new Hugo theme - though all the code is already there, so it's just a matter of migrating
3. DNS/Registry - Switch to Namecheap?

Also -- Quick thank you to [@spf13 (Steve Francia)]([https://github.com/spf13/) for making [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)
